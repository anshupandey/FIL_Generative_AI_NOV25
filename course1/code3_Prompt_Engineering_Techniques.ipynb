        "\n",
        "**Description:** Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) is a prompting technique designed to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by explicitly prompting the model to generate a draft response, then generate verification questions for its own response, answer those questions independently of the initial draft, and finally use the answers to revise and improve the original draft. This creates a self-correction mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks requiring high factual accuracy and reduced hallucination, such as question answering, summarization of factual information, and generating reports or summaries based on provided text. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex or potentially ambiguous information where the model might otherwise confidently generate incorrect details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When factual accuracy is critical and errors could be harmful or misleading.\n",
        "- To reduce hallucinations and improve the reliability of the model's output.\n",
        "- When verifying information against external sources is not immediately feasible or desired within the prompting process itself.\n",
        "- For generating summaries or answers that require synthesizing information from multiple potential points within the model's knowledge or context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate Initial Draft:** The model first generates a direct answer or response to the original prompt.\n",
        "2. **Generate Verification Questions:** The model is then prompted to generate questions that would help verify the correctness of the statements made in the initial draft.\n",
        "3. **Answer Verification Questions:** The model answers these verification questions *independently* of the initial draft, drawing from its internal knowledge or provided context. This step is crucial as it prevents the model from simply confirming its own potential errors.\n",
        "4. **Revise Initial Draft:** The model compares the answers to the verification questions with the original draft and revises the draft to align with the verified information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative process helps the model identify inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its initial output and correct them before presenting the final response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example (Conceptual):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt: \"Explain the process of photosynthesis and its main outputs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initial Draft (Internal):** \"Photosynthesis is how plants make food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The main output is oxygen and sugar.\" (Might contain slight inaccuracies or missing details).\n",
        "2.  **Generate Verification Questions (Internal):**\n",
        "    *   \"What are the inputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What are the outputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What is the role of chlorophyll?\"\n",
        "    *   \"Where does photosynthesis primarily occur in a plant?\"\n",
        "3.  **Answer Verification Questions (Internal, independently):**\n",
        "    *   \"Inputs are carbon dioxide, water, and light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Outputs are glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"It occurs mainly in chloroplasts within plant cells.\"\n",
        "4.  **Revise Initial Draft (Internal, based on verified answers):** \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and light energy from the sun. Using the energy absorbed by chlorophyll in their chloroplasts, they convert these inputs into glucose, a sugar they use for energy and growth, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct.\"\n",
        "\n",

            "- **Client:** [Client Name]\n",
            "- **Credit Rating:** [Rating]\n",
            "- **Purpose:** Hedging foreign exchange exposure\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Benefits:**\n",
            "1. **Hedging:** The primary purpose of the trade is to hedge against foreign exchange exposure, which can stabilize cash flows and protect against adverse currency movements.\n",
            "2. **Market Positioning:** If the client has a strong view on the EUR/USD pair, this trade could allow them to lock in favorable rates, potentially benefiting both the client and the bank through increased business.\n",
            "3. **Revenue Generation:** The bank may earn fees or spreads from facilitating this trade, contributing positively to its revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Immediate Red Flags:**\n",
            "1. **Credit Risk:** The size of the notional value ($100,000,000) raises concerns about the counterparty's creditworthiness. A low credit rating could indicate higher risk.\n",
            "2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Given the size and complexity of the trade, it is crucial to ensure compliance with regulations such as Dodd-Frank and EMIR, which govern derivatives trading.\n",
            "3. **Market Volatility:** The FX market can be volatile, and the pricing of the forward may not accurately reflect future market conditions, leading to potential losses.\n",
            "4. **Operational Capacity:** The bank must have the necessary systems and processes in place to manage the settlement and ongoing monitoring of this trade.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Is the counterparty's credit risk within acceptable limits for a trade of this size and tenor?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Review the client's credit rating and internal credit risk limits. If the client has a low credit rating (e.g., below investment grade), the trade may exceed acceptable risk thresholds, necessitating further scrutiny or collateral requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Does this trade comply with all relevant regulatory requirements for derivative transactions?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Confirm that the trade adheres to Dodd-Frank and EMIR regulations, including reporting requirements and clearing obligations. If the trade is not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP), ensure that it meets the criteria for non-cleared trades.\n",

            "3. **Does the pricing of this derivative accurately reflect current market conditions and volatility?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Analyze the pricing model used for the FX forward. Compare it with market quotes and implied volatilities to ensure it is competitive and reflects current market conditions. Any discrepancies may indicate pricing risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **How does this trade impact the bank's overall exposure to the underlying asset?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Assess the bank's existing exposure to the EUR/USD pair. If the bank already has significant exposure, this trade could exacerbate risk. A comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted to evaluate the cumulative impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Are the operational processes and systems in place to handle the settlement and ongoing management of this specific derivative type?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Verify that the bank has the necessary operational infrastructure, including systems for trade capture, risk management, and settlement processes. Any gaps could lead to operational risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Has the client undergone the necessary suitability and appropriateness checks for complex products like this?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Ensure that the client has been assessed for suitability, particularly given the complexity of FX forwards. This includes understanding the client's financial situation, investment objectives, and experience with derivatives.\n",

            "- **Market Pricing:** If the pricing aligns with market conditions, the trade is viable. If not, renegotiation may be necessary.\n",
            "- **Overall Exposure:** If the trade does not significantly increase the bank's exposure to the EUR/USD pair beyond acceptable limits, it can proceed. If it does, risk mitigation strategies should be implemented.\n",
            "- **Operational Readiness:** If operational processes are robust, the trade can proceed. If there are gaps, these must be addressed before execution.\n",

It encourages the model to interleave thinking steps (Reasoning) with taking actions (Acting) through tools or interacting with an environment. The model observes the outcomes of its actions and uses this information to refine its subsequent reasoning and actions. This allows the model to perform tasks that require interacting with external sources of information or performing physical (or simulated physical) actions.\n",

The model then uses the Observation to inform its next Thought and Action.\n"
