    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you understand key concepts in LangGraph, a powerful framework for building stateful, graph-based AI workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs). It is assumed you are familiar with LangChain, but LangGraph is new to you. The notebook is divided into three parts: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced, guiding you step-by-step from basic concepts to complex multi-agent systems."

    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain that allows you to create stateful, graph-based workflows for AI applications. Unlike traditional linear chains in LangChain, LangGraph models interactions as a graph, where nodes represent actions (e.g., calling an LLM, using a tool) and edges define how to move between them. This is particularly useful for applications requiring state management, cycles, or complex decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components:\n",
    "- Nodes: Individual steps or actions (e.g., call an LLM, execute a tool).\n",
    "- Edges: Connections between nodes, defining the flow (can be conditional).\n",
    "- State: A shared data structure that persists across nodes, tracking information like user input, LLM outputs, or tool results.\n",
    "- Graph: The overall structure combining nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why LangGraph?:\n",
    "- Enables stateful workflows where previous steps influence future ones.\n",
    "- Supports cycles for iterative processes (e.g., retrying a tool if the answer is incorrect).\n",
    "- Ideal for agentic systems where an AI decides which tools to use dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use LangGraph?\n",
    "Use LangGraph when your application needs:\n",
    "- Complex workflows: When a simple linear chain (e.g., LangChain’s Chain) isn’t enough.\n",
    "- State persistence: To maintain context across multiple steps (e.g., user query history).\n",
    "- Decision-making agents: For scenarios where an AI must choose tools or actions dynamically.\n",
    "- Iterative processes: When you need loops, retries, or conditional branching (e.g., verify and retry if a tool’s output is wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Building a chatbot that uses tools (e.g., search, calculator) based on user queries.\n",
    "- Creating multi-agent systems where agents collaborate to solve a task.\n",
    "- Managing workflows with conditional logic, like routing queries to different LLMs or tools."

Located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay on the island of Luzon, it is classified as a highly urbanized city. With 43,611.5 inhabitants per square kilometer (112,953/sq mi), Manila is one of the world's most densely populated cities proper.\n",
      "Manila was the first chartered city in the country, designated by Philippine Commission Act No. 183 on July 31, 1901. It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No. 409, \"The Revised Charter of the City of Manila\", on June 18, 1949. Manila is considered to be part of the world's original set of global cities because its commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific Ocean and connect Asia with the Spanish Americas through the galleon trade. This marked the first time an uninterrupted chain of trade routes circling the planet had been established.\n",
      "By 1258, a Tagalog-fortified polity called Maynila existed on the site of modern Manila. On June 24, 1571, after the defeat of the polity's last indigenous ruler, Rajah Sulayman, in the Battle of Bangkusay, Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi began constructing the walled fortification of Intramuros on the ruins of an older settlement from whose name the Spanish and English name Manila derives. Manila was used as the capital of the captaincy general of the Spanish East Indies, which included the Marianas, Guam, and other islands, and was controlled and administered for the Spanish crown by Mexico City in the Viceroyalty of New Spain.\n",
      "In modern times, the name \"Manila\" is commonly used to refer to the entire metropolitan area, the greater metropolitan area, and the city proper. Metro Manila, the officially defined metropolitan area, is the capital region of the Philippines, and includes the much larger Quezon City and the Makati Central Business District.\n",
      "The Pasig River flows through the middle of Manila, dividing it into northern and southern sections. The city comprises 16 administrative districts and is divided into six political districts for the purposes of representation in the Congress of the Philippines and the election of city council members. In 2018, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network listed Manila as an \"Alpha-\" global city, and ranked it seventh in economic performance globally and second regionally, while the Global Financial Centres Index ranks Manila 79th in the world. Manila is also the world's second most natural disaster-exposed city, yet is also among the fastest-developing cities in Southeast Asia.\n",

Located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay, the region lies between the Central Luzon and Calabarzon regions. Encompassing an area of 636.00 km2 (245.56 sq mi) and with a population of 13,484,462 as of 2020, it consists of sixteen highly urbanized cities: Manila—the capital city—Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, along with one independent municipality, Pateros. As the second most populous and the most densely populated region in the Philippines, it ranks as the 7th most populous metropolitan area in Asia and the 6th most populous urban area in the world.\n",
      "The region is the center of culture (including arts and entertainment), economy, education, and the government. Designated as a global power city, the region exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment both locally and internationally.

    "- State (AgentState): Tracks query, tool_decision, tool_output, final_answer, and retry_count.\n",

    "    - verifier_node: Checks if the tool’s output is correct. If incorrect, it triggers a retry.\n",

    "- Tool: The calculator tool evaluates math expressions but occasionally returns a wrong answer (for demo purposes) to test the retry logic.\n",

    "- Conditional Edges: Allow the graph to choose the next node dynamically based on the state. For example, route to different tools based on the query type (math vs. general knowledge).\n",

    "    - LLM Node: Handles general knowledge queries.\n",
    "    - Verifier: Checks the output and decides to retry or accept.\n",
    "- Define Tools: Reuse the calculator tool and add an LLM as a “tool” for general queries.\n",
    "- Build the Graph: Use conditional edges to route based on tool decision and verification.\n",
