This methodology applies to \\nfunds receiving a star rating from Morningstar, except in Japan where these are the Ibbotson Stars. \\nThe Morningstar Rating has the following key characteristics:\\nThe peer group for each fund’s rating is its Morningstar Category™.\\nRatings are based on funds’ risk-adjusted returns.\\nMorningstar Category\\nThe original Morningstar Rating was introduced in 1985 and was often used to help investors and \\nadvisors choose one or a few funds from among the many available within broadly defined asset \\nclasses. Over time, though, increasing emphasis had been placed on the importance of funds as \\nportfolio components rather than “stand-alone” investments. In this context, it was important that \\nfunds within a particular rating group be valid substitutes for one another in the construction of a \\ndiversified portfolio. For this reason, Morningstar now assigns ratings based on comparisons of all \\nfunds within a specific Morningstar Category, rather than all funds in a broad asset class.\\nRisk-Adjusted Return\\nThe star rating is based on risk-adjusted performance. However, different aspects of portfolio theory \\nsuggest various interpretations of the phrase “risk-adjusted.” As the term is most commonly used, to \\n“risk adjust” the returns of two funds means to equalize their risk levels before comparing them. The \\nSharpe ratio is consistent with this interpretation of “risk-adjusted.”\\nBut the Sharpe ratio does not always produce intuitive results. If two funds have equal positive \\naverage excess returns, the one that has experienced lower return volatility receives a higher Sharpe \\nratio score. However, if the average excess returns are equal and negative, the fund with higher \\nvolatility receives the higher score because it experienced fewer losses per unit of risk. While this \\nresult is consistent with portfolio theory, many retail investors find it counterintuitive. Unless advised \\nappropriately, they may be reluctant to accept a fund rating based on the Sharpe ratio, or similar \\nmeasures, in periods when the majority of the funds have negative excess returns.\\nStandard deviation is another common measure of risk, but it is not always a good measure of \\nfund volatility or consistent with investor preferences. First, any risk-adjusted return measure \\nthat is based on standard deviation assumes that the riskiness of a fund’s excess returns is well \\n3\\n3')"
